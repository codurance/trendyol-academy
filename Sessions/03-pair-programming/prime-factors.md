| 2       | [2]       | It's a prime number        |
| 3       | [3]       | It's a prime number        |
| 4       | [2, 2]    | It's a compound number     |
| 6       | [2, 3]    | It's a compound number     |
| 8       | [2, 2, 2] | It's a compound number     |
| 18      | [2, 3, 3] | It's a compound number     |
